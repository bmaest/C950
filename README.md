# Optimal Package Delivery System

## Project Description
This Python project implements a greedy algorithm alongside a chaining hash table to optimize package delivery routes within a city. The goal is to minimize the total distance traveled while ensuring that all packages reach their destinations by their deadline.

## Features
- **Greedy Algorithm**: Utilizes a greedy approach to select the shortest possible route at each step of the delivery process.
- **Chaining Hash Table**: Employs a chaining hash table to manage package data effectively, ensuring quick retrieval and update operations.
- **Reporting**: Generates detailed reports on delivery times, distances covered, and route efficiency.
